Python OrderedDict 

OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted.

A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order

If the value of a certain key is changed, the position of the key remains unchanged in OrderedDict.

 Deleting and re-inserting the same key will push it to the back as OrderedDict, however, maintains the order of insertion.

popitem(last=True)
The popitem() method for ordered dictionaries returns and removes a (key, value) pair. 
The pairs are returned in LIFO order if last is true or FIFO order if false.

move_to_end(key, last=True)
Move an existing key to either end of an ordered dictionary. The item is moved to the right end if last is true (the default) or to the beginning if last is false. Raises KeyError if the key does not exist:
